This is the python code I wrote for a Bioinformatics project I did in school. 

I ended up using the HPC to generate some phylogenic trees out of gene orthologs, 
I attached the final output from the HPC if you were curious, but this code was used to generate the strings
of the trees I would use to input into RAxML.
